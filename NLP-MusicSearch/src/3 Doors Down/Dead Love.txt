I don't mind what you do to me
I don't mind what I cannot see
If you care you will stay with me
If you dare you will set me free

If you let me try I will let you see again
If I let you die you will let me sleep again
Would you sell your soul for a game you like to play?
If you let me go I will burn your heart away

Well your here when you should be gone
And my heart well its turned to stone
If I'm dead by the time you find out just why I'm gone
Just say goodbye

If you let me try I will let you see again
If I let you die you will let me sleep again
Would you sell your soul for a game you like to play?
If you let me go I will burn your heart away
