Lay me down
Wash this blood off my hands for me while I cry out
Don't let me die before I go to sleep
And I can't keep going
But I cannot start again

This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break

These walls I make
They could hold me in and hold me back today
Oh but tomorrow's new and I'll walk right out and walk right over you
If you hear me screaming
Please don't let me fall again

This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break

My time is on its way
I'll fall but I won't break

This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break

This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break
