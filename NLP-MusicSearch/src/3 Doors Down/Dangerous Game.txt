You stand before me
Now we stare eye to eye
Before another second clicks away, one of us will die
You reach for your metal as I reach for mine
The sound of bullets flying through the air is followed by a cry

And there cryin'

What will we do, what will we say when it’s the end of this game that we play
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend
Or will we start this game over again
It's coming back to me

The young man lies alone, but fastened into the ground
The sound of fleeing feet and the cryin' eye will be his last sound

But do we gain from all this?
Now, was it worth a life? no
We throw all of our hopes away
And set our dreams aside

Now we’re cryin'

What will we do, what will we say, when it’s the end of this game that we play
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend
or will we start this game over again
It’s coming back to me 
It’s coming back to me 
It’s coming back to me

What will we do, what will we say, when it’s the end of this game that we play
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend
or will we start this game over again
