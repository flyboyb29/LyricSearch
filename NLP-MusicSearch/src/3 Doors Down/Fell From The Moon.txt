I fell to the earth below
And I heard everyone that I know
Well it's gonna be hard
And it's gonna leave scars
Somedays were born to lose
Today, I fell from the moon

I don't know how to get back
Or how to make up for all that I lack
But I'm gonna get there and I'm not gonna be scared
I got so much to prove
Today, I fell from the moon

Cause I, I flew above the earth some
I've danced under the warm sun
I've watched the stars light up a room
And now, I hope the heavens help me
I pray that they might let me back
But if they don't then what will I do?
Today, I fell from the moon

I don't know where I belong
Or how long they say I've been gone
But I'm gonna be strong
And try to find my way home
That's all that I can do
Today, I fell from the moon

Cause I, I flew above the earth some
I've danced under the warm sun
I've watched the stars light up a room
And now, I hope the heavens help me
I pray that they might let me back
But if they don't then what will I do?
Today, I fell from the moon

Today, I fell from the moon
