Why do you make me feel so ugly inside and out
What is it I say what is in your brain
That makes you so damn sure that

What you want is what I'm trying to be
Nothing's real but what's inside
If I'm so blind then how can I see
I can feel you pulling me under
I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down
I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down

Why should I try when nothing I do makes you proud
All the words you say they don't mean a thing
The silence screams so loud

What you want is what I'm trying to be
Nothing's real but what's inside
If I'm so blind than how can I see
I can feel you pulling me under
I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down
I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down

I'm down
I'm down
I'm down

I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down
I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down

I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down
I can't hold on like this with you bringing me down

I'm down
I'm down
