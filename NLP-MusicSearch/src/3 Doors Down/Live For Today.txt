Show me the road and i will find my own
You build your bridges and i'll burn em down
So far away and all alone i roam
I'll take my chances in the here and now

And all you wonder is who's for sale, well you wont know now and i wont tell
Your always hiding throwing up your hands
While heroes ride again

And god only knows all the places ive been
But i love this life that i'm living in 
I wont look back to regret yesterday
Were not handed tomorrow so i'll live for today

Another day and yet anothers done spending a life living with in the past
I'll take the chance before the chance has gone
You never know when it'll be your last

But still you wonder who's for sale, well you wont know now and i wont tell
Your always hiding throwing up your hands
While heroes ride again

And god only knows all the places ive been
But i love this life that i'm living in 
I wont look back to regret yesterday
Were not handed tomorrow so i'll live for today

We'll know when we run out of time until its all over with 
And there'll be no where to run
We'll never say it but we're over out heads and we're drowning inside with all the things we've said

And god only knows all the places ive been
But i love this life that i'm living in 
I wont look back to regret yesterday
Were not handed tomorrow so i'll live for today

God only knows all the places ive been
But i love this life that i'm living in 
I wont look back to regret yesterday
Were not handed tomorrow so i'll live for today
