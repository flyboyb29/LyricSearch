Nevermind the face that you put on
In front of me
And nevermind the pain
You've put me ..through

Cause every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
It makes me doubt all of this

What are you waiting for?

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me

Forget about the trip that you've been on
Or so it seems
Nevermind the lies that you told, my tears

Cause every little thing you said
And every little thing you did
You made me doubt all of this

Is that what your waiting for?

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me
Was meant for me
Was meant for me
Yeah, Yeahhhhhh

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me

I don't know how I can face this pain 
I'll keep it inside so you can't see
I don't think I can go on this way, 'cause it's not me
