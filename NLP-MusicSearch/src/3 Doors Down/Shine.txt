This is about to be history
Nobody's gonna take it from me
I'm gonna show you something you've got to see
Trust me people will remember this day cause

It's my time to shine
Cause I know what could be mine
It's all layin on the line so
It's my time
It's my time to shine

I think about this moment day and night
This is the only thing that I've ever known
I believe I can and I think I'm right
I'm gonna take this back to where it belongs cause

It's my time to shine
Cause I know what could be mine
It's all layin on the line so
It's my time
It's my time to shine

I'll shine
I'll shine

It's my time to shine
I know what could be mine
It's all layin on the line so
It's my time
It's my time to shine
