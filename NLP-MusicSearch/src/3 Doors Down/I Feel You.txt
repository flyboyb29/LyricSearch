They gave me a life that's not so easy to live
And then they sent me on my way
I left my love and forgot my dreams
I lost them along the way
Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me

And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights?
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see? the only thing that gets me through this is what I feel and I feel you

And this ain't no bed of nails
But there not roses just the same
Got this road sure can be long
Another endless day, another seven hundred miles that'll take me further from my home

Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me

And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see the only thing that gets me through this is what I feel and I feel you

I know what you're going through now
Believe me I live this

And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see the only thing that gets me through this is what I feel and I feel you
