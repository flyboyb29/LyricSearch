Say goodbye to all my troubles
Say goodbye to this 
I'm saying goodbye to all the desperation I've lived in
It doesn't hurt to talk about it
It sometimes helps me through
Now there's nothing left to talk about
I'll tell you...

Now it's time to say goodbye
I've been living this lie for way to long
I can't handle this life got to say goodbye
I've been living this lie for way to long

Blame it on this way of thinking
Blame it on someone
There's no answers only questions that have come undone
It doesn't help to think about it
It only makes me feel used
Now there's nothing left to think about
Nothing's true...

Now it's time to say goodbye
I've been living this lie for way to long
I can't handle this life got to say goodbye
I've been living this lie for way to long

I wish that we could do this all again
I wish that I could stay but I can't
And now it's time to leave this all behind
Of all the things to say we said goodbye

Now it's time to say goodbye
And now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to say goodbye
I've been living this lie for way to long

I can't handle this life
I can't handle this life
I can't handle this life
I'm dead
