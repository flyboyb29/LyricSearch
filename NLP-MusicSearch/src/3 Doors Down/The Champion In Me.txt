You said that mountains too high,
You said that oceans too wide
I've heard all new beginnings
started with an end
Watch this journey I take,
turn into something I make
Please watch closely,
you may not see this again

Cause I, know I,
I was born to be this way
Everyday I try and I'll do
everything that it takes
to become the one
what I've always wanted to be
Watch right now
and you will see the champion in me
The champion in me

When the others cower,
I'm in my finest hour
We are champions created by design
While I remember falling,
I hear these dreams keep calling
I work so hard, so long,
I'll take it what is mine

Cause I, know I,
I was born to be this way
Everyday I try and I'll do
everything that it takes
to become the one
what I've always wanted to be
Watch right now
and you will see the champion in me
The champion in me
Champion, champion in me,
champion, champion

Cause I, know I,
I was born to be this way
Everyday I try and I'll do
everything that it takes
to become the one
what I've always wanted to be
Watch right now
and you will see the champion in me
The champion in me
