Small town boy with a big town dream
Wants to fly, but he can't find wings
And they said he's only wasting his time
You taste that dream too far, it's time for you to change
If it's alright by you, can I just stay the same?

Cause everybody's got a right to change
I didn't say that I would
Sometimes you have to do your own fate
And I think that I should
Everybody's got a right to dream
I'm gonna be the one I wanted to be, yeah
You better believe it

Hey there boy, look at where you are
That guitar will never take you far
And they said he'd die without a dime
But his heart only beats to songs he longs to play
And his mouth only speaks the words he wants to say

Cause everybody's got a right to change
I didn't say that I would
Sometimes you have to do your own fate
And I think that I should
Everybody's got a right to dream
I'm gonna be the one I wanted to be, yeah
You better believe it
