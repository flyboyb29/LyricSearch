I live in Sin City
She's no good
And he's too pretty
And I can't show my skin
A human far too pretty

I live in the heat of the night
Lock every door and shut all the blinds
I feel it caving in

Why gotta be so cold
Gotta be so closed off
Why you gotta be like that
Like I'm knowing you cold look
Like we both don't bleed red

Why you gotta be so hard
Like I'm not a beating heart
Don't we share the same stars
Come on baby, heal my world with open arms
Come on baby, heal my world with open arms

You don't look so alien to me
What's all this foreign soil
Let's go from here

Don't be so scared of everything
You look like you've seen a ghost

Have you ever made a lover out of a stranger
Have you ever made an ally in the crowd
Baby I won't let you fall
Baby I won't let you drown
Have you ever made a lover out of a stranger
Have you ever made an ally in the crowd
Baby I won't let you fall
Baby I won't let you drown

Why gotta be so cold
Gotta be so closed off
Why you gotta be like that
Like I'm knowing you cold look
Like we both don't bleed red

Why you gotta be so hard
Like I'm not a beating heart
Don't we share the same stars
Come on baby, heal my world with open arms
