Palms up, no crown
You wanna mess around
I wanna hold you down
It's not okay
I need you everyday

I wanna hold you down
It's not okay

I lost all the pride
That I thought I could keep
Can you see me?
Say you feel me
It's a big world
But I fall at your feet
Reach out and touch me

I lost all the pride
That I thought I could keep
Can you see me?
Say you feel me
It's a big world
But I fall at your feet
Reach out and touch me

The throne that would not break
My heart is for the taking
And I cannot save face
Cause I keep rearranging for you, babe

Fold and fold
And darkness on my knees
Is this love or harness?
Baby, please tell me

And darkness on my knees
Is this love or harness, baby

And darkness on my knees
Is this love or harness?

And darkness on my knees
Is this love or harness, baby
