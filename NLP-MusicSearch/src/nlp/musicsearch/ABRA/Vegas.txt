Well I'm a live one
Always wanna go, wanna ride, can you keep up?
Give me one of those, tell me that you gone buy me one?
I get you and I get you into so much trouble, hot gun
Walking at the top, I don't stop
I don't give up, no
No one's left behind
Walking on the edge, I do my best to do you right
Right, right, right, right
Right, right, right

If you wanna roll the dice on me, okay
If you think you can afford it, come play, come play
Lady luck, let me kiss that chain
Lay with me in Vegas
If you wanna roll the dice on me, okay
If you think you can afford it, come play, come play
Lady luck, let me kiss that chain
Lay with me in Vegas
