Years ago, you evaporated from an overdose
I'm the dope, now I hear you strung out and you want some more
That's a no, you know I don't fuck with ghosts
You know I already exercised you out so call the
Call the

Call the other bitch that you knew so well
Funny how I knew you even better than you knew yourself
That's some shit
Wonder why I never put my tongue on it
Wonder why I never hit the blunt when you put bud in it
Let you know

Now it's coming clear, you see
I know you love games and you not 'bout to play me
I know that my name keeps you up late and crazy
Just throw it all away like you ain't ever met me
Now I see you starting to see things clearly
I know you love games and you not 'bout to play me
I know that my name keeps you up late and crazy
Just throw it all away like you ain't ever met me, yeah

Never met me
You never met me

Take what you said back
Take what you said back

You never met me

Take what you said back
Know that you ain't meant that
Feel it in my gut
Now I need a six pack
I was on that late grind
You thought it was playtime
Why you tryna act like you make time
You think it a bomb
You think I was wrong
You think I was on drugs
Shit, maybe I was, but I'm awesome
Now I lost my baby, you're an orphan
You like me when I'm nailing it and it is in a coffin

Call the other bitch that you knew so well
Funny how I knew you even better than you knew yourself
That's some shit
Wonder why I never put my tongue on it
Wonder why I never hit the blunt when you put bud in it
Let you know
