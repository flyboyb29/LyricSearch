You know you can do what you please
If leaving is your goal, then please go by all means
I will not hold you down so give me back my keys
But, first, come get your shit and wash my bed sheets
I cannot stomach all the smells of who you used to be
And, men of my imagination cannot lay with me
And, men of my imagination cannot stay with me

What, so you mad?
Didn't you say it ain't that serious, in fact?
Did you seriously expect me to be sad?
Maybe am but baby you won't see none of that
He said, "You crazy lady"
I said, "You ain't seen nothing yet, baby"

Cause I am more than atoms and notions
Smoke mirrors and potions
A bag of bones in motion
Come drown in my ocean

Cause I am more than atoms and notions
Smoke mirrors and potions
A bag of bones in motion
Come drown in my ocean

You tell me that you're sorry
But, baby we already both knew that
You tell me that you need me
But, baby, I'm not coming back
And no I will not pardon a rolling stone
A heartless soul or a bag of bones with no control
Yes, I'm a rock
But, my shades of gray will not be shaded jade today

Cause I am more than atoms and notions
Smoke mirrors and potions
A bag of bones in motion
Come drown in my ocean

Cause I am more than atoms and notions
Smoke mirrors and potions
A bag of bones in motion
Come drown in my ocean

Well, I'm poor in peace and I'm poor in serenity
So, I'll pour me up another one of these
And if this too should pass, well I'll drink to that
We could pour me into an hourglass
