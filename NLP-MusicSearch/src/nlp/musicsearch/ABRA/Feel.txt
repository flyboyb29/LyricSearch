I do not know my way
But I'll go bursting through the flames
Till I get it

Be damned to be so bold
I did not see the light
But I got a taste of what it might be like

What's the good to feel bad
It's just natural baby
Let them care if they care
We're just animals baby

All I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel
Human

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel
Human

Do you know where I can buy some peace to pocket?
Do you know where I could be?

Packed up my woes
And I threw them in a rocket
But they don't know they don't know they don't know
They hide a well kept secret
And I don't mind to keep it
If they don't wish to seek it seek it

What's the good to feel bad
It's just natural baby
Let them care if they care
We're just animals baby

All I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel
Human

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel
Human

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel
Human

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel
Yeah
