I do not know my way
But I'll go bursting through the flames
Till' I get it, get it
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)

Be damn to be so bold
I didn't not see the light
But I got a taste
For what it might be like

What's that good to feel bad?
It's just natural baby
Let's don't care if they care
We're just atoms baby

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel human
Yeeeeaaaah

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel human

Do you know where I could find some peace to pocket?
Do you know where I could be?
Packed up my woes and I threw em' in a rocket
Then I turned the sky grey

But they don't know, they don't know
They had a well kept secret
And I don't mind to keep it
If they don't wish to seek it, seek it

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel human
Yeeeeaaaah

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel human

[Male voice:] That would make me feel [x32]

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel human
Yeeeeaaaah

And all I ever wanted
And all I ever need
Is a beat and a hum
That can make me feel human
Yeeeeaaaah
