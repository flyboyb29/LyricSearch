Look what you did, killed on us, dead
On the plane, in the rain, back from LA
Remember when I, remember what I
How could you do me this way?
Do you remember when we first kissed?
How did it get this far to a place like this?
Oh why are you so cold to me?
Why you acting like we ain't nothing?
No turning back now
Got the Devil, well, too bad
Better waste it, put your money in my bank
I'm bad, yeah yeah
And it looks like rain
Baby take me when you ready
Baby I can get loud
And it looks like rain
And it looks like rain, rain, rain

You're calling me a crybaby
But you're making me cry
Oh yeah, you're calling me a crybaby
But you're making me cry
You're calling me a crybaby
But you're making me cry
Oh yeah, you're calling me a crybaby
I'll show you a crybaby, yeah yeah

Always catching myself at night
Only go out when the sun goes down
I cry an ocean of emotion
Inside, I am lover's island but I write him a riptide love
Soon, no one will turn back now
I got your sensitive at will
Fuck that, better waste it, put your money in
My life, let me worry 'bout that

Banging on my foot
I go up and down, up and down
Banging on your walls
I go up and down, up and down
Banging on my foot
I go up and down, up and down
Banging on your walls
I go up and down, up and down
Banging on my foot
I go up and down, up and down
Banging on your walls
I go up and down, up and down
Banging on my foot
I go up and down, up and down
Banging on your walls
I go up and down, up and down

You're calling me a crybaby
But you're making me cry
Oh yeah, you're calling me a crybaby
But you're making me cry
You're calling me a crybaby
But you're making me cry
Oh yeah, you're calling me a crybaby
I'll show you a crybaby, yeah yeah
