Don't you wanna feel like someone special
Don't you wanna be loved and adored
Don't you wanna feel like someone special
Cause I wanna be loved and adored
By you, you, you, you

I thought you told me that I was someone special
You used to call me your baby girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
I want you to hold me but you cannot be bothered, bothered
And you turned your back on me as my eyes watered, watered, watered
But I will not force you to love me
I guess it don't matter
I didn't realise that you didn't feel the same
And I guess I am to blame
After all this time, after all this time
I guess you'll never, never be mine
And after all this time, after all this time
I guess I'll be fine, fine, fine, fine
Why can't you look me in these eyes you adored
Oh you do not love me no more?
And why after you try to say it isn't so
You are so hurried to go

Don't you wanna feel like someone special
Don't you wanna be loved and adored
Don't you wanna feel like someone special
Cause I wanna be loved and adored
By you, you, you, you

I want you to hold me but you cannot be bothered, bothered, bothered
And you turned your back on me as my eyes watered
But I will not force you to love me
I guess it don't matter, matter, matter
I didn't realise that you didn't feel the same
And I guess I am to blame
After all this time, after all this time
You'll never, ever, ever be mine
And after all this time, after all this time
I guess I'll be fine, fine, fine, fine

Don't you wanna feel like someone special
Don't you wanna be loved and adored
Don't you wanna feel like someone special
Cause I wanna be loved and adored
By you, you, you, you
