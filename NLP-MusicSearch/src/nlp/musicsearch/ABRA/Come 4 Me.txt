I'm 'bout to dive in my honey
Then flip that band and make more money
Go tell them girls you can't come for me
Go tell the world that they can't come for me, come for me
I'm 'bout to dive in my honey
Then flip that band and make more money
Go tell them girls you can't come for me
Go tell the world that they can't come for me, come for me
