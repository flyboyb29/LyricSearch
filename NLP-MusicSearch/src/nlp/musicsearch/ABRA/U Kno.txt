Put it down like

Baby I don't wanna run
And make me feel like a woman, tonight
Baby I don't wanna hide
I don't wanna be that sweet tonight

Put it down like you do
Come out of the rain, I wanted to say
Just like you do, just like you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Cause you know
Just how to do it
And I don't wanna be alone
So babe please come calm the storm

Cause you know
Just how to do it
And I don't wanna be alone
I can't take it anymore

Don't get it twisted babe
I don't ever do my thing this way
Let's not sink our ship
Secretly drown out, I'll cover your mouth

Put it down like you do
Come into the rain, I wanted to say
Just like you do, just like you do
(Just like you do, just like you do)

Cause you know
Just how to do it
And I don't wanna be alone
So babe please come calm the storm

Cause you know
Just how to do it
And I don't wanna be alone
I can't take it anymore

Take me far away from here
Take me to your sin city

Take me far away from here
Take me to your sin city

Take me far away from here
Take me to your sin city
