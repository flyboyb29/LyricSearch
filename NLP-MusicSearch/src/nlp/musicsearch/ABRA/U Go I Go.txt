As this world makes a thousand revolutions
I keep coming to the conclusion that we
Weren't meant to
Walk through this fire alone
Walk through this fire alone
And as I try and and wade through the confusion
I get caught up in the illusion that I'm only a
Storm unto my own
Unto my own

But I was thinking I would
And you was thinking you could
And we was thinking we should
Get it together babe
Get it together babe

But I was thinking I would
And you was thinking you could
And we was thinking we should
Get it together babe
Get it together babe

Beating down the block at night
Baby let me into your empire
Your home will be my home
Your gold will be my gold
Where you go I will go
I'll take on your religion and
Take all your other women baby

Beating down the block at night
Baby let me into your empire
Your home will be my home
Your gold will be my gold
Where you go I will go
I'll take on your religion and
Take all your other women baby

Here we are
All alone
Cold as snow
You and me
Could there be anything
Greater than
What we know
And where we stand
What we'll do
And what we'll see
Boy I don't know
But I can feel
My teenage animal
Rising up
To fill your cup
And yes I can

Well I was thinking I would
And you was thinking you could
And we was thinking we should
Get it together babe
Get it together babe

Well I was thinking I would
And you was thinking you could
And we was thinking we should
Get it together babe
Get it together babe

Beating down the block at night
Baby let me into your empire
Your home will be my home
Your gold will be my gold
Where you go I will go
I'll take on your religion and
Take all your other women baby

Beating down the block at night
Baby let me into your empire
Your home will be my home
Your gold will be my gold
Where you go I will go
I'll take on your religion and
Take all your other women baby

I wanna be near to you
I wanna be close
I wanna just feel you
I don't wanna do the most
