Trial thru flames I can beat that
I'll do it my way and take the whole throne
And I will be the one that I can cling to
Me and only me alone

Trial thru flames I can beat that
I'll do it my way and take the whole throne
And I will be the one that I can cling to
Me and only me alone

'Cause I got the love
Got the power
'Cause I got the love
Got the power
'Cause I got the love
Got the power

Lights coarse through my veins
I see the stars
Lights coarse through my veins
I see the stars I am the same
Darkness say my name
'Cause you know I'll remain
I'll remain

Lights coarse through my veins
I see the stars
Lights coarse through my veins
I see the stars I am the same
Darkness say my name
'Cause you know I'll remain
I'll remain, I'll remain, I'll remain

'Cause I got the love
Got the power
(Let's go now) [x15]

Calm the storm
Rule the seas
Move the mountain
(Got got the love)

Calm the storm
Rule the seas
Move the mountain
It's all in me

Calm the storm
Rule the seas
Move the mountain
(Got got the love)

Calm the storm
Rule the seas
Move the mountain
It's all in me

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

All In Me
