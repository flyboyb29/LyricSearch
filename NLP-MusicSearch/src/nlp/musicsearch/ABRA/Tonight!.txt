Love is on my lips
And I can't figure out just what to do with it
But open wide so you can come inside with me
High tides in my chest
You're giving me the look
The one that you do best
And I feel so high so yeah I'm down to ride
With thee

At this very moment I've lost my words
You're challenging me and I've got the nerve
I usually don't do this but that's alright
Tonight tonight
We can go wherever you want to
I'll hit the dusty trail with you
Stole your ride I'm on the passenger side
Tonight tonight

Lick it out the bag
I'm saying words and
Doing things I never have
But you feel so damn fine
You can come inside with me
Crawling up my neck
Well baby I'm so alive
Slap me just to check
And we're always coming
Coming up on the crest
Take me

At this very moment I've lost my word
You're challenging me and I've got the nerve
I usually don't do this but that's alright
Tonight tonight
We can go wherever you want to
I'll hit the dusty trail with you
Stole your ride I'm on the passenger side
Tonight tonight
