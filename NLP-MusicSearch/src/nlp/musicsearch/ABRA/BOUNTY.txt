Sights on
Why are your sights on me?
Run a search on your name
And I'm coming up empty

I see you turning all my corners
Black bandanna
Ford like a rock
Popping wheelies in spaghetti junction
Like you someone hot
And if you're coming then just come on
And we can get it popping popping
Popping, popping
I see you turning all my corners
Black bandanna
Ford like a rock
Popping wheelies in spaghetti junction
Like you someone hot
And if you're coming then just come on
And we can get it popping popping

I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me

Like you gotta bounty out on me
Like you gotta bounty out on me
Like you gotta bounty out on me
Like you gotta bounty out on me

Bridge:
I see you lift the sheets
Hover over me
Pour it up
A wet dream
Still I felt it
In the deep of the night
I felt so cold I called the cops
Don't try to go so quick
You can't leave with my head
Lift the sheets
Hover over me
Pour it up
A wet dream
Still I felt it
In the deep of the night
I felt so cold I called the cops
Don't try to go so quick
You can't leave with my head

I see you turning all my corners
Black bandanna
Ford like a rock
Popping wheelies in spaghetti junction
Like you someone hot
And if you're coming then just come on
And we can get it popping, popping
Popping, popping
I see you turning all my corners
Black bandanna
Ford like a rock
Popping wheelies in spaghetti junction
Like you someone hot
And if you're coming then just come on
And we can get it popping, popping
Popping, popping

I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me
I feel like, feel like you been watching me
I feel like, feel like you been stalking me

Like you gotta bounty out on me
Like you gotta bounty out on me
Like you gotta bounty out on me
Like you gotta bounty out on me
