I feel the windows quake
And the vases breaking
And my flowers wild
Who's to be kind tonight?
Storming through your room
Look what you are making
Look my love, I'm shaking
I'm shaking

I'm so far gone
But it's still riding
Stole my soul
And my pressure's rising
You don't know
What you do to me
What you to do me
To me
To me me

They wanna take me away
And they wanna blame me
I just wanna cry
They just wanna tame me
A heart is a shame
A tear is a terrible thing to waste
And love is a miserable thing to chase

I didn't mean to lose my mind
But time has been unkind
Wired on lies and wine
How could I possibly be fine?
If you showered me in diamond love
Or showed me your heart of gold
It could all be so simple
Or so I've been told
Or so I've been told
Or so I've been told
Or so I've been told
Or so I've been told

I'm so far gone
But it's still riding
Stole my soul
And my pressure's rising
You don't know
What you do to me
What you to do me
To me
To me me
To me me

I'm so far gone
I'm so far gone
I'm so far gone
I'm so far gone
