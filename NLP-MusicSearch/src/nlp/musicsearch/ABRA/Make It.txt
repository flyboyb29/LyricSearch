I guess you gave up
I guess you quit trying me
Why don't you call
Did you just forget about little old me
Did you cut the cord
Did it take more than you can afford
Or desire to spend
Is it all about to end
Yeah

Show me where it hurts
I wanna make this work
I wanna lay my hands on you
I wanna do this thing for us
Tell me if it stings
Its true love I can bring
To the table
If I am able
For you baby

I know that they say nothing lasts forever
But baby we got something here
We got something here
Wouldn't you say
Didn't you hear
Or do you really think the trail has gone cold
Do you really think we're too far from home
No I don't think so
I don't think so

Well show me where it hurts
I wanna make this work
I wanna lay my hands on you
I wanna do this thing for us
Tell me if it stings
Its true love I can bring
To the table
If I am able
For you baby

I get so attached it's my bad
I can't let go
Of your beautiful soul
