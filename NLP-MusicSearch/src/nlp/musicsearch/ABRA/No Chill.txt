Protect your heart at all costs
No one who walks the earth
This golden paradise is lost
Nothing is worth the tears
And never let them see you cry, cry

It's all so stupid
You're gonna lose it, (yeah, yeah)
You're gonna blow it if you don't get in control

But I'm not trying to win
I'll crave this, just let me live
I'm not trying to win
I'll crave this, just let me live
I'm not trying to win, baby
I'll crave this just let me live
I'm not trying to win (win, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Everyone's talking bout their fallback game, game, game
I've got no fucking chill, cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart, and they think that I'm crazy
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, yeah)

Everyone's talking bout their fallback game, game, game
I've got no fucking chill, cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart, and they think that I'm crazy
(I'm crazy, I'm crazy, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna dance with you
Cause they say that your kiss may kill me
Then I'll be in too deep
And drop myself off at your feet
I knew that you were bad news
Stayed awake till half past two
Had me slap you, cause I was thinking about you
It's all so stupid
You're gonna lose it, yeah, yeah
You're gonna blow it if you don't get in control

But I'm not trying to win
I'll crave this, just let me live
I'm not trying to win
I'll crave this, just let me live
I'm not trying to win, baby
I'll crave this just let me live
I'm not trying to win (win, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
