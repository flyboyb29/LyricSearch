It's so cool the way you hype me up
Pump me on the notion that you could be the one
You was drunk on the idea that I would be lost without your love
But you knew how fast you were to run
Don't get so excited fantasizing that you got a girl like me hunting you
I was following your lead but if that night meant nothing, it can mean nothing to me too

This ain't my first time on this ride
Tell it like it is baby you ain't got to lie
This ain't what you think and I ain't tryna be your wife
So tell it like it is and do me right

This ain't my first time on this ride
Tell it like it is baby you ain't got to lie
This ain't what you think and I ain't tryna be your wife
So tell it like it is and do me right

Do me
Right

Do me
Right

Do me
Right

Do me
Right

Do me

You got your flexing little fingers all over me
Next time you better wash your hands of that shit before you call me
Always running game like I don't see right through you
I'm grown, why can't you just tell the truth
Don't get so excited fantasizing 'bout how you got a girl like me hunting you
I was following your lead but if that night meant nothing, it can mean nothing to me too

This ain't my first time on this ride
Tell it like it is baby you ain't got to lie
This ain't what you think and I ain't tryna be your wife
So tell it like it is and do me right

This ain't my first time on this ride

New year new me, dick on fleek
Got a brand new freak, such dick don't speak
yeah I eat her hollow
Show time at the Apollo only kiss her if she swallow
Mmhhm Skurt Skurt, yeah I'm tryna fuck, not just tryna be a flirt
Go on date, get desert, pop a perc
Mix pleasure with the work, got you coming out your shirt
Pass it then I hit it, I can't tell you what I'm high on
Your boyfriends a bitch got this dick for you to cry on
Money to dry your eyes on, ripping off them nylons, fucking with the lights on
Bend over let me see it, you remind me of a Prius
I just want to get inside, I'm not really tryna to keep it
Bad at keeping secrets, Illuminati tryna leak it
Make it tight I'm bout to peak, do me right and change the sheets

Do me
Right

Do me
Right

Do me
Right

Do me
Right

Do me
