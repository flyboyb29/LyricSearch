Hey mister rain man
Come rain down on me
Let me tell you what I been through these days
What I been through these days
Hey mister man come
Come stand by me
I got something on my chest
Let me tell you what I been through these days
What I been through these days

I just want some affection
I just need your attention

We don't gotta be in love I just need somebody
Need need somebody right now

All that straight talk clears the room

Just be ready for a good time
I'm a wild thing are you down with it
We don't gotta make things weird and shit

I'm a wild thing are you down with it
We don't gotta make things weird and shit
