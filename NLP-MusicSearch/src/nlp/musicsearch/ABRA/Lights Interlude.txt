Girl don't make me chase it
You know I want it
I ain't tryna find replacements
Might get that text at 2am
"Girl you awake?"
My night ain't over
Still got all this drugs and drink
What happens, happens
You know you got what I want
Slick I know you want it too
You playing games and waiting
For a nigga to come onto you
Making eye contact
And I can see just what you're thinking
And I see you're wanting chivalry
From me? Must be mistaken
I'm drinking come hit this bottle
Got pills if you gone pop em
My daily affirmation tryna
Get them panties droppin
We both know what you came for
Retreating ain't an option
Just be honest with yourself
I can tell you hear your conscious saying

I can turn the lights off
It's a freakshow if you want it
I could put you so on
Got the drugs, let's have a party
Now the lines are so crossed
And we are so gone
I could put you so on
We're so on

I can turn the lights off
It's a freakshow if you want it
I could put you so on
Got the drugs, let's have a party
Now the lines are so crossed
We're getting so gone
I could put you so on
We're so on
