Tell me what you did last night
Did you close your eyes and think about me
Like I think about you
Tell me why you always fight
Waiting on you get with it
What's with the resistance baby?

Don't listen to a word they say
I'm in your head like every day
And you deny yourself
And then you scream my name
And I can't take it
No don't listen to a word they say
I'm in your head like every day
And you deny yourself and then you scream my name
And I can't take it
No, I can't take it

Come chase the night with me
They say I'm bad, you say it back
But you know you don't believe that
Eat the fruit that feeds your spirit
On your knees, now baby eat it, eat it

Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me all the way from across the room?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me all the way from across the room?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me all the way from across the room?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me all the way from across the room?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me?

Don't listen to a word they say
I'm in your head like every day
And you deny yourself
And then you scream my name
And I can't take it
No don't listen to a word they say
I'm in your head like every day
And you deny yourself and then you scream my name
And I can't take it
Don't listen to a word they say
They aren't in in your head like
They aren't in in your head like
They aren't in in your head like
They aren't in in your head like
They aren't in in your head like
They aren't in in your head like
They aren't in in your head like

Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me all the way from across the room?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me all the way from across the room?
Are you really gonna stand there
Staring at me?
