It's always special this time
It's always more different than I knew
I take the long way to the city
I only wanna be with you

When you're not around everything stands still
I try to make it spin
Frail like my porcelain
Constitution when it comes to you

Comes to you

It's always special this time
It's always more different than I knew
I take the long way to the city
I only wanna be with you

When you're not around everything stands still
I try to make it spin
Frail like my porcelain
Constitution when it comes to you

Comes to you

I know you think I'm cheeky
I'm gonna make you dance
Saying all the right things
I'm gonna make you laugh

I know you think I'm cheesy
I'm gonna make you dance
Saying all the right things
I'm gonna make you dance
