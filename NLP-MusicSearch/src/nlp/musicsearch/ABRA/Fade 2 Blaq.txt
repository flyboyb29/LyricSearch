I will be the only one
I will hang the moon and sun
Be there when it fades to, fades to

I will be the only one
I will hang the moon and sun
Be there when it fades to, fades to

Even if they let you down they can never make you fall
And they don't understand they think we think we know it all
What is fear you can embrace?
Don't close your eyes, don't turn your face, don't be afraid
Don't look back and fall to salt
Don't be scared now just be strong
Shake it off (shake it off yeah)
Shake it off (shake it off yeah)

I can be the only one
I will hang the moon and sun
Be there when it fades to black
I will always have your back
If your love is all that
I can be the only one
I will hang the moon and sun
Be there when it fades to black
I will always have my back
If my love is all that

Would you live in heaven forever
It's suicide, it's idle baby we know better
Cause triumph tastes so sweet when we've been living on our knees
Oh lord triumph tastes so sweet so sweet
When we've been crawling on our knees
Don't let go if there ever was a soul to trust its me
And baby I hope all the shit we done been thru has made you see
Don't let go if there ever was a soul to trust its me
And baby I know all the shit we done been thru will help you

I can be the only one
I will hang the moon and sun
Be there when it fades to black
I will always have your back
If your love is all that
I can be the only one
I will hang the moon and sun
Be there when it fades to black
I will always have my back
If my love is all that

Be there when it fades to
Be there when it fades to
Black, black, black
