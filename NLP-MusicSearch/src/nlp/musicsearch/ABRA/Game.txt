Protect your heart at all costs
No one who walks the earth is golden
Paradise is lost
Nothing is worth the tears
And never let them see you cry [?] and everything dies

It's all so stupid
You're gonna lose it
You're gonna blow it
If you can't get in control
But I'm not tryna win
I crave this
Just let me live

Everyone's talking bout their fall back game, game, game
But I've got no fucking chill
Cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart
And they think that I'm crazy
I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
Everyone's talking bout their fall back game, game, game
But I've got no fucking chill
Cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart
And they think that I'm crazy, crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
Yeah, yeah

I don't wanna dance with you
Cause they say that your kiss might kill me
But I'll be in too deep
And drop myself off at your feet
I knew that you were bad news
Stayed awake about half past two
Had to slap me, cause I was thinking about you

It's all so stupid
You're gonna lose it
You're gonna blow it if you don't get in control
But I'm not tryna win
I crave this, just let me live
I'm okay with looking crazy over it

Everyone's talking bout their fall back game, game, game
But I've got no fucking chill
Cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart
And they think that I'm crazy
I'm crazy
Am I crazy?

Everyone's talking bout their fall back game, game, game
But I've got no fucking chill
Cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart
And they think that I'm crazy
I'm crazy, crazy
Well you can think I'm crazy

Everyone's talking about their fall back game, game, game
But I've got no fucking chill
Cause love is like a drug to me
I wanna share my heart
And you can think I'm crazy, crazy
I'm crazy
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy about you
