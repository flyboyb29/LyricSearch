It's a brand new day
And already this world is closing in
The telephone rings
And here I go again

Lord, I need You here to bring
Some rest to my heart
I whisper Your name
and Lord right there You are

When I'm with You
This world stops turnin'
One look in Your eyes
And my heart stops hurting
I love the way that You know
Just what to do
With me
When I'm with You

We've all had those days
When nothing would work out right
Those up and down days
They turn into sleepless nights

When we need You here
To bring some rest to our hearts
We whisper Your name and Lord
Right here You are

One day the sun and the moon will stop shining
Every star is going to fall from Heaven
But on that day I won't be afraid
I know You'll be there beside me
