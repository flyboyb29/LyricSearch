Well I was walkin' down the street
Just theother day
Mindin' my own business I say
I saw a bloke standin' on the side of the
Street and waving his bible and being
Everything but discreet

You know what's right from wrong don't
Say, no way
Don't wait till things go wrong seek
Him today

Love and joy and peace and hope
Is what He offers us

You know I'm not usually one to stop
And talk to people like this - you know
But something inside of me was building
Up and needin' to find out what he'd say
He said


Well that was several months ago
Now my life has changed because
Someone cared to say...
He stands at the door of your
Heart and knocks
Open up the door
And keep it locked today, today
