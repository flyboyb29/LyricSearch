Your stuck on a chain
And your toeing a lie
Seems like everytime that you catch up
You only fall behind

And your trapped inside this world you made yourself
But that's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
That's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me

There is always someone to blame
For the things you do yourself
You think that everything that's going wrong
Is because of someone else

And your trapped inside this world you made yourself
That's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
It's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me

Cause I'm on the outside and I'm looking in

And that's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
It's not the world I live in
This is not the life for me
Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me
Cause my world is bigger than your problems
And it's bigger than me...
