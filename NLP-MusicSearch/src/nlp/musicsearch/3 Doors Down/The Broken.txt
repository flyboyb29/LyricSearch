This is the call to the broken, the broken

Take it from me.
They don't care if you're lonely.
As you can see,
They don't care if you're scared.

Your heart
Is the only friend you have in this whole world.
Don't start,
Think you can do this yourself.

This is the call out.

This is the call to the broken.
To all the ones who've been thrown away.
This is the call to the broken.
Stand up and take back your world today.

Stand up

I know what you're thinking.
You say you're tired of keeping score, keeping score.
Trust me,
You're not the only one going through this.
You see,
I've been through this before, this before.

This is the call out.

This is the call to the broken.
To all the ones who've been thrown away.
This is the call to the broken.
Stand up and take back your world today.

This is the call to the broken.
Were going to do this our own way.
This is the call to the broken.
Stand up and take back your world today.

They found their strength in a weakness
To keep us there where we fall down,
But now we hold all the pieces
To change the world this is the call out

This is the call to the broken.
To all the ones who've been thrown away.
This is the call to the broken.
Stand up and take back your world today.

This is the call to the broken.
Were going to do this our own way.
This is the call to the broken.
Stand up and take back your world today.
