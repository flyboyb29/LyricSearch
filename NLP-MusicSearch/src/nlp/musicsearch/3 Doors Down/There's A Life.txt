When the days all seem to count for nothing
Is the hope that I hold onto now gonna count for something?
When the nights all feel like they're running together
That's when I keep on dreaming about things getting better forever
All the days that come and go
Across miles so far from home
All I find roads that ramble on and on and on

There's a life, there's a life that I'm missing
So much more than I can see
There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasing
That always stays one step ahead of me

Out of reach but I know that I'm getting closer
I believe that as long as I breathe that the dream's never over
Inside myself I try to find a way to keep this hope alive
I hold the line that keeps me hanging on and on and on

There's a life, there's a life that I'm missing
So much more than I can see
There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasing
That always stays one step ahead of me

There's a life, there's a life
There's a life, there's a life I see
There's a life, there's a life
There's a life, there's a life for me

There's a life, there's a life that I'm missing
So much more than I can see
There's a life, there's a life that I'm chasing
That always stays one step ahead of me
