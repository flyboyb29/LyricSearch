There were never any right words to say
Somehow those words would never come
Even when I thought it all out
No matter what I said or done
And I kept getting in my own way
Always looking for number one
I felt like I was lost in the crowd
But I can hear you calling my name

That’s where your love found me there
Lost and alone and headed nowhere
That’s where your love found me there
Maybe you didn’t know

You whispered the words that I needed
And maybe I didn’t show
When my broken heart was afraid
But there was no where that I could run
And when all of my dreams had conceded
And they ran away
You gave me more than I could explain
And I can hear you calling my name

That’s where your love found me there
Lost and alone and headed nowhere
That’s where your love found me there
Falling apart and no one was there
That’s where your love found me there
Killing myself and I didn’t care
That’s where your love found me there

That’s where your love found me there
Lost and alone and headed nowhere
That’s where your love found me there
Falling apart and no one was there
That’s where your love found me there
Killing myself and I didn’t care
That’s where your love found me there
