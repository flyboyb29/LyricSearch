Things that they say
I'm so tired of games that they play
Always pretending that they know what comes at the ending
Well they brought the lies and believe there's no freedom
We'll be the ones who can say we don't need them

Come on, come on
Let's enjoy the ride
Cause we only know what's inside of these lights
And I wanna know what's on the other side
And we'll keep on going until there's only us and the night

Some people pay to make us believe the things that they say
But I don't
What they don't know is we got so much more than we show
They only want us to think that they're stronger
Now we don't have to pretend any longer

Come on, come on
Let's enjoy the ride
Cause we only know what's inside of these lights
And I wanna know what's on the other side
And we'll keep on going until there's only us and the night

I've spent my whole life waiting for this day to come
Now at last I see I'm not the only one
So come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Come on, come on
Let's enjoy the ride
Cause we only know what's inside of these lights
And I wanna know what's on the other side
And we'll keep on going until there's only us and the night

Come on, come on
Let's enjoy the ride
Ooh, cause we only know what's inside of these lights
And I wanna know what's on the other side
And we'll keep on going until there's only us
