She says, I got something to say
She knows what she says will change everything
She's laid through so many sleepless nights
She’s crying, she’s crying, she’s crying

Mother. That man took my soul away
Father. How could you ever treat me this way?
Brother. Don't ever let him do this again
This time it’s over I’m gonna make it end
Now it’s over and the old man is in
Lying on the ground. Bullet in his head

She stood at the foot of the guilty bed last night
She held what could set her free for the rest of her life
She did all that she said that she planned to do
She’s through, she’s through, she’s through, yeah

Mother. That man took my soul away
Father. How could you ever treat me this way
Brother. Don't ever let him do this again
This time it’s over I’m gonna make it end
Now it's over, the old man is dead
Lying on the ground. Bullet in his head

There’s a bullet in your head
I kept fallin' down, look who's fallin' now
I kept cryin' out, look who's cryin' now
I kept fallin' down, look who's fallin' now...
I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready

Now it’s over, this is what she said
He's lyin' on the ground. Bullet in his head.
