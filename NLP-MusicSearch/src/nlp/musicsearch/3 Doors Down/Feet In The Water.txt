Please be careful what you say
You might give that little heart away
Just remember everything I give
You might have a little time to live

Just remember everything I’ve lost
Truly you’ll remember everything it cost
Would you pay attention please?
Or make the same mistakes as me

I’m getting tired of you never understanding a word that I’m trying to say
Because you won’t listen to me

I’m not going to wade out so far
That I can’t stand on my own
You know I like it with my feet in the water
So please don’t leave me here alone

Just be careful what you say
You might give that little soul away
Will you throw away these days?
Without ever knowing your name
I’m getting tired of you never understanding a word that I’m trying to say
Because you won’t listen to me

I’m not going to wade out so far
That I can’t stand on my own
You know I like it with my feet in the water
So please don’t leave me here alone

I want it
I feel it
I want it
I feel it
I need it more

I wanna watch you wade out so far
That you can’t stand on your own
You’re like a child with your feet in the water
And I can’t leave you alone

I’m not going to wade out so far
That I can’t stand on my own
You know I like it with my feet in the water
So please don’t leave me here alone
