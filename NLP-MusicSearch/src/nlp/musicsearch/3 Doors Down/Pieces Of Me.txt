An open door I can't walk through
Cause I can't leave behind all these things that I knew
They're all gone
And I've lost track
Of all the ones I loved and turned my back
Inside myself the words I say
It couldn't be the truth when lies got in the way

But tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me

These tired eyes and hollow skin
They remind me of the places that I've been
I feel so far, but still so close
It feels like I'm living inside my own ghost

But tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings the chance that I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me

I've gone to sleep in heaven
Only to wake in hell
If I'm gonna make it through this now then I'll have to save myself

Cause tomorrow will be a brand new day
And I hope that it brings a chance I forgot to take
And I know there's so much I can be
If I can be strong enough to throw away these weak pieces of me
