Light me a candle, I’m comin’ home.
Then leave it by your side where I belong.
I’ve been in this cold world for so long.
So Light me a candle, I’m coming home.

I wanna feel the love that’s in the hearts;
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves,
that’s where my Christmas lives.

Snow on the window, asleep by the fire
Somehow these children never get tired
Missing the ones that, we wish were here
Remembering the ones who look on but we don’t shed a tear

I wanna feel the love that’s in the hearts;
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves,
that’s where my Christmas lives.
In these heart set loves,
that’s where my Christmas lives

All along the halls are ringing,
choirs singing Christmastime is gone,
in trees the lights are streaming,
children gleaming christmastime is gone,
oooh we still knowing christmas time is gone
ooooh we still knowing

I wanna feel the love that's in the hearts;
of all the ones that make us who we are
thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
in this heart set loves,
that's where my Christmas lives
